// Write a function called returnDay. this function takes in one parameter (a number from 1-7) 
// and returns the day of the week (1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, etc.)  
// If the number is less than 1 or greater than 7, the function should return null. 
// In some countries Sunday is treated as the first day of the week, 
// but for this exercise we will use Monday as the first day.

// returnDay(1) // "Monday"
// returnDay(7) // "Sunday"
// returnDay(4) // "Thursday"
// returnDay(0) // null
